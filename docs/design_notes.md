# Game Design Notes

## Sources of Inspiration

- Ghibli Films
- Firaxis XCOM

## Basic Mechanisms

- Save uncorrupted lifeforms before demonic creatures consume their lifeforce (expanding their own)
- Every lifeform has a demonic counterpart
- Slaying demons risks becoming infected
- Once infected you are bestowed with demonic powers. Of course using these powers comes with a price
