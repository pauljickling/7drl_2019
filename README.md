# 2019 7drl

The [7drl challenge](https://7drl.com/) for 2019.

[Code for dungeon generator](https://gist.github.com/munificent/b1bcd969063da3e6c298be070a22b604) by Bob Nystrom and used with [his permission](https://twitter.com/munificentbob/status/1101934812762238976). All other code by Paul Jickling

**Status: Incomplete**

This code represents the totality of what I worked on. This is my first time attempting to make a game, and it should be as a learning experience rather than a functioning piece of software. What this amounts to is a working terminal display of a randomly generated dungeon that you can move around in, and bump into doors and walls. What it doesn't have is any meaningful interactivity/game systems in place. All in all, this was a fun exercise trying to develop a game from scratch at a fairly low level of abstraction. I think next year I will try again using an actual library however :-)
